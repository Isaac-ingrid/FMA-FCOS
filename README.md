# FMA-FCOS
A multi-sensor deep learning fusion object detection network for Multi-scenario Object Detection on USVs.
The FMA-FCOS dataset comprises 7 distinct scenarios, totaling almost 7000 sets of camera and millimeter-wave radar data.

## This is the dataset of the paper - "Millimeter-wave Radar and Camera Fusion for Multi-scenario Object Detection on USVs".

We provide usable camera and millimeter-wave radar files.
